## Algorithim V0.0 ##

If an Entity contains any of the [Conditions] included in the [Tag Criteria], give that entity a [Tag_Score] of: [Scoring_Values] * the Tag`'s [weight_modifier] for that condition.

   Example: If an Entity has a dash give that enetity a Score of: [500 range, 16 second cooldown, 70 mana cost, ] * the Tag`'s [weight_modifier] for that condition.

If an Entity's [Total_Tag_Score] passes that tag's [Minimum_Requirement] assign the [Tag] to the Entity

## Tag Assignment Algorithim v0.1 ##

# Notes

## Algorithim V0.0

- If an Entity has/is [Attribute_Condition] give the Entity a [Tag_Score] of [###]
- If an Entity's [Total_Tag_Score] passes that tag's [Minimum_Requirement] assign the [Tag]
- The [Tag_Score] for each Entity is based on the results of the total [Tag_Weights] and the [Attribute_Elements]


## Scoring Algorithim v0.1

If [Entity] has a [Entity_Tag_Score] which is [Comparision_type] than [Score_amount_One]

OR,

If [Entitiy_group] has a [Sum_of_Tag_Score] which is [Comparision_type] than [Score_amount_Two]

<!-- **Algorithim Plain Text**
*If an Entity's tag Score is above the defined amount for this type of Entity then this Entity would receive that Tag.

*If the sum of an Entity Group's Tag_Scores is above the defined amount for this type of  entity group then this Entity Group would receive that Tag.-->

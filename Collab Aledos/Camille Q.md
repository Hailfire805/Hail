OR,

If [Entitiy_group] has a [Sum_of_Tag_Score] which is [Comparision_type] than [Score_amount_Two]

Scaling tag- I want to give players something actionable to plan their gameplay around based off of who scales well and who doesn't.

If the entity does the same type of damage that it scales from, then its easier to itemize to penetrate that kind of defense which would mean a higher offence tag rating
